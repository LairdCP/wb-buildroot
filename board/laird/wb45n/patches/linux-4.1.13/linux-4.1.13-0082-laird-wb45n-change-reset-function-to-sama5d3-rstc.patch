Subject: [PATCH] laird: wb45n: change reset function to sama5d3-rstc

After the slow clock has been enabled on the reset controller via upstream
changes, the dram disable access and power down code is causing the SAM9G25
to hang occasionally on reboot.  Using the simple reset function provided
for SAMA5D3 instead.
