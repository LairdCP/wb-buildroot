# /usr/sbin/lighty_wd
# Keeps watch of whether a lighttpd process is running, and if it is,
# then actively disables lighty for inetd. When the lighttpd is not
# running, then restores lighty for inetd. The updates are performed
# on a configuration copy: /tmp/inetd.conf
#
# This allows inetd to trigger lighty for starting lighttpd on :443.
# While running, lighttpd will be able to claim the port directly.
#
# Usage:
#  lighty_wd
