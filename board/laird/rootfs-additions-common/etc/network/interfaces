# /etc/network/interfaces
# Usually included by the "ifupdown" package, however "ifrc" is used instead.
#
# This file is parsed by the networking init script, and also by "ifrc".
# 
# Organized by sections:  Localhost, Wired, Serial, Wireless, ...
# Each section should have an interface stanza:  iface <dev> <addr> <method>
# Option/value pairs intended for the iface must follow the interface stanza.
#  
# See the manpage/documentation for this file, so that it remains compatible.
# Command directives not used:  pre-up, post-up, pre-down, post-down
# Other options such as mapping and run-parts/phases are not used by "ifrc". 
#
# The "ifrc" utility understands these additional options:
#  alias <dev> [is] <actual-dev>
#  portspeed <10baseT|100baseT|10baseT-HD|...etc>
#  timeout <seconds>
#
# Optional command-on-config directives:
# These command directives may be shell command statements or other executable
# scripts; they are run in a backgrounded sub-shell for a specific interface.
#  pre-cfg-do <shell command or script and args to do before configuration>
#  post-cfg-do <shell command or script and args to do after configuration>
#  pre-dcfg-do <shell command or script and args to do before deconfiguration>
#  post-dcfg-do <shell command or script and args to do after deconfiguration>
