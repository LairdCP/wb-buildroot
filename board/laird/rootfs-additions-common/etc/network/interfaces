# /etc/network/interfaces
# This 'eni' file is parsed by the 'ifrc' (interface-run-config) utility,
# and also by the 'S??network' init-script.
# 
# Each section has an interface stanza:  iface <dev> <addr> <method>
# Indented <option value> pairs intended for the iface must follow the stanza.
#
# This type of file is usually included by the Debian 'ifupdown' package.
# However, 'ifrc/ifplugd' is used instead, for embedded interface management.
# See the manpage/documentation for this file, so that it remains compatible.
#
# Options that 'ifrc' does not use:
#  mapping and run-parts/phases
#  directives... pre-up, post-up, pre-down, post-down
#
# Additional options that 'ifrc' does understand:
#  alias <dev> [is] <actual-dev>
#  portspeed <10baseT|100baseT|10baseT-HD|...etc>
#  timeout <seconds>
#  directives...
#  pre-cfg-do <shell command or script and args to do before configuration>
#  post-cfg-do <shell command or script and args to do after configuration>
#  pre-dcfg-do <shell command or script and args to do before deconfiguration>
#  post-dcfg-do <shell command or script and args to do after deconfiguration>
#  ...these are run in the background for the specific interface
#  ...see example *.conf files in /etc/network
