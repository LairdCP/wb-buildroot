#  Read-only Root-FS for SOM60 using overlayfs
#  Version 1.0
#
#  Created 2017 by Pascal Suter @ DALCO AG, Switzerland to work on Raspian as custom init script
#  (raspbian does not use an initramfs on boot)
#  Modified by Boris Krasnovskiy to work with Laird Connectivity SOM60

#  Tested with Raspbian mini, 2017-01-11
#
#  This script will mount the root filesystem read-only and overlay it with a temporary tempfs
#  which is read-write mounted. This is done using the overlayFS which is part of the linux kernel
#  since version 3.18.
#  when this script is in use, all changes made to anywhere in the root filesystem mount will be lost
#  upon reboot of the system. The SD card will only be accessed as read-only drive, which significantly
#  helps to prolong its life and prevent filesystem coruption in environments where the system is usually
#  not shut down properly
#
#  Install:
#  copy this script to /sbin/overlayRoot.sh and add "init=/sbin/overlayRoot.sh" to the cmdline.txt
#  file in the raspbian image's boot partition.
#  I strongly recommend to disable swapping before using this. it will work with swap but that just does
#  not make sens as the swap file will be stored in the tempfs which again resides in the ram.
#  run these commands on the booted raspberry pi BEFORE you set the init=/sbin/overlayRoot.sh boot option:
#  sudo dphys-swapfile swapoff
#  sudo dphys-swapfile uninstall
#  sudo update-rc.d dphys-swapfile remove
#
#  To install software, run upgrades and do other changes to the raspberry setup, simply remove the init=
#  entry from the cmdline.txt file and reboot, make the changes, add the init= entry and reboot once more.
