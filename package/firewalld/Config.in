	  Firewalld provides a dynamically managed firewall with
	  support for network or firewall zones to define the trust
	  level of network connections or interfaces. It has support
	  for IPv4, IPv6 firewall settings and for ethernet bridges and
	  a separation of runtime and permanent configuration options.
	  It also provides an interface for services or applications to
	  add ip*tables and ebtables rules directly.
